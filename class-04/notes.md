Notes on Whitboarding:

- need to practice more
- don't love whiteboarding YET
- focus on the QUESTION before the solution
- hard to talk and think
  - getting as comfortable as you can with your tools makes it easier
    **Good things**
- very fluid with the tool, seemed prepared
- stream of conciousness thought asking questions and answering
- stream of thought questioning
- talking out loud
- good communication - can they explain things simply
  **Improvements**
- algorithm: having a solid plan!
- same, but the approach in general of solving the problem before coding
- handling the time pressure!
- feeling more confident when talking through code
