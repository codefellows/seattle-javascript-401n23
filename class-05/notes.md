## Hot Takes

- singly and doubly linked
- have a next (and sometimes previous) property
- beinging is the head
- end is refered to as the tail
- kinda like an array but can only move through it one way
- any particular node knows only about itself (data) and who is next (unless doubly and then knows previous)
